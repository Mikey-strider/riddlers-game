# Riddle Me This?!

Welcome to ***Riddler's Game!*** We are so excited that you could be *coerced* into joining us.

While I got you *tied* up, let's play a little game, shall we?

If you can solve all my puzzles in the allotted amount of time you win. But if you don't then you lose, and you don't want to find out what happens if you lose!

**There are 3 levels:**

1. Poison Ivy's level: Game is based on botany/ biology, and chemistry.
2. Penguins level: Game is based on aviary and fashion.
3. My level aka(Riddler's) level: Game based on pop quiz style riddles.

***Game Play:***

**Rules:**

* Each level has a time limit in which to solve the puzzle(s).
* Also the entire game itself has a time limit.
* Each Puzzle solved leads into the next level, where the timer gains time back in a selected allotment.
* As you move forward in the game the levels will increase in difficulty.
* At the end of each level you will be given a code (anagram) that will also need to be solved.
* After all levels are finished you will give me the solved codes to receive a special commendation.
* There will be hints and clues to each game play.
* You may of course scour the internet for answers.
* A ding sound chime will go off every time you get an answer correct, and a buzzer style sound for incorrect answers. Once three wrong answers have been given a horn will sound off and the screen will go to black or maybe start glitching before returning to the home screen.

***MVP:***

1. get basic game functionality up and running. Be able to solve the puzzles and move through the game. Timers working and all inputs working.
2. No music and maybe some sounds like the dings and horns for correct or wrong answers.
3. Have the title of the theme at least available to users who may know where they are in the levels. Bonus games might be available if I have enough time.
4. At least use a question mark background for the home screen. With all the rules set up and easy to read and understand.
5. all buttons must work as well.

## Game Play part 2

***The Code:***

**1. Home Page:**

    * A clean home page. Theme based on the Riddler's color. So contrasting Bright green, Dark Green, Black and some highlight colors for accents. Most likely yellow and/or white.
    * I would like to have a cool little video on repeat in the background like that of a security camera screen. But I will use an image of something like first.
    * Rules will be displayed on home page plus my little story from the beginning of the doc to help set the mood of the game.
    * Timer will be placed in the upper right hand corner and will begin counting down once the start game button has been clicked.
    * Once a level has begun, you will see a second timer show in a similar spot but only larger.

**2. Poison Ivy's Page:**

    * Softer greens with some red accents will be used in this level.
    * Theming is plants and chemistry.
    * Sound will be bubbling beakers, leaves brushing the ground, and maybe some electricity buzzing.
    * The game will consist of multi choice questions based on Ivy's ability to hybridize plants, animals, and chemistry. I.E. One question might be: What are the two plants that were turned into the plant hybrid. Based on the latin root of this new plant name (the genus latin name of the plant species), select the correct answer. Chemistry will use the periodic table to help.
    * At the end of the level a jumbled up word will be given as the prize.

**3. Penguin's Page:**

    * Purples and dark grays will be the color theme for this page. With an empty aviary cage in the background for the image.
    * Sound will be wind, random bird noises, and subtle other sounds or music.
    * This game will be about birds and fashion. QUestions will be about Character history and the times he likes to use, as well as his fascination with birds.
    * One question you will be given a work=d and you will have to select an item from a collection of images and you will need to know the correct item.
    * Again with the level beaten a jumbled up word will be given as the prize.

**4. Riddler's page:**

    * Home page color theming will be used again with the dark and bright greens with yellow and white accents.
    * Sound will be several clocks ticking out of sync with a slight music underlay that is also a little creepy.
    * game play is as follows: first section with be a set of 5 spitfire riddles that you have to solve as quickly as possible. Next will be the harder riddles pertaining to the riddler's story. But this will be a multiple choice questions. Final section will be a cipher puzzle where you need to figure out the answer by looking on the page itself for clues. Once that puzzle is solved you will be given the final jumbled up word.

**5. Last game anagram solver page:**

    * This level will just be an empty page with three input boxes where you must unscramble the words and put them in the right order.
    * Once you have done that a special message(personally from me) will appear thanking the person for playing my game. A button will appear and take them back to the home screen.
      ** If I can figure out how to do it, maybe collect their times and let them know how well they did time wise.

**6. End of Game!**

** *I am hoping to possibly have a hidden easter egg somewhere as well in either the home page or end page.*
