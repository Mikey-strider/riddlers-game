    <p>Welcome to <strong>Riddler's Game!</strong> We are so excited that you could be coerced into joining us.
      <br>
      <br>
      While I got you tied up, let's play a little game, shall we?
      <br>
      <br>
      If you can solve all my puzzles in the allotted amount of time you win.
      But if you don't then you lose, and you don't want to find out what happens if you lose!

    </p>
    <h4>There are 3 levels:</h4>
    <ul>
      <ol>Poison Ivy's level: Game is based on botany/ biology, and chemistry.</ol>
      <ol>Penguins level: Game is based on aviary and fashion.</ol>
      <ol>My level aka(Riddler's) level: Game based on pop quiz style riddles.</ol>
    </ul>

    <h3>Game rules:</h3>
    <ul>
      <ol>1. Each level has a time limit in which to solve the puzzle(s).</ol>
      <ol>2. Also the entire game itself has a time limit.</ol>
      <ol>3. Each Puzzle solved leads into the next level, where the timer gains time back in a selected allotment.</ol>
      <ol>4. As you move forward in the game the levels will increase in difficulty.</ol>
      <ol>5. At the end of each level you will be given a code (anagram) that will also need to be solved.</ol>
      <ol>6. After all levels are finished you will give me the solved codes to receive a special commendation.</ol>
      <ol>7. There will be hints and clues to each game play.</ol>
      <ol>8. You may of course scour the internet for answers.</ol>
      <ol>9. A ding sound chime will go off every time you get an answer correct, and a buzzer style sound for incorrect
        answers.
        Once three wrong answers have been given a horn will sound off
        and the screen will go to black or maybe start glitching before returning to the home screen.</ol>
    </ul>
